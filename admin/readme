# HOW TO CREATE THE ROOT-ADMIN USER

Step 1: Hash the root admin password:

Since the root admin has no register logic, you will need to manually create the record within the database.
First hash the password using argon2 and then enter the record into the database.

To hash use the command below:
php -r "echo password_hash('root-admin-password', PASSWORD_ARGON2I);"

save the hash and use it in the next step.

Step 2: Enter the record into the database:
Use the sql command below:
INSERT INTO root_admin (username, password) VALUES ('adminuser', '$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=4,p=1$eW91clNhdXBsZVBhc3N3b3Jk$abcdefgh1234567890abcdef');
